GENNY,23.87,2021,"€58,000 – €70,000",5,10,6,Jacuzzi; Jet-ski; Seabob; SUP,Greece,Sunreef 80,Sunreef Yachts,"**Hey there,**

If you’ve ever dreamed of slipping off the crowded summer beaches and gliding into a hidden cove with the Mediterranean sun painting everything gold, you need to meet **GENNY**. I’ve spent a week aboard this Sunreef 80, and honestly, it feels like she’s an extension of the sea herself— sleek, spacious, and surprisingly intimate, even though she’s a full‑blown 23.87 m (almost 78 ft) floating palace.

### What makes Genny special?

First off, she’s a Sunreef. That name carries weight in the sailing world—a brand that blends the engineering rigor of a yacht builder with the soul of a bespoke yacht. Built in 2021, Genny still bears that fresh‑off‑the‑dock aura, but she’s already been seasoned – the hull’s been sliced through the Ionian and the Aegean enough to know how to behave in a gusty Zephyr while still feeling buttery smooth when the wind drops. The 80‑foot model is a sweet spot—big enough to feel luxurious but still small enough that you can walk from the helm to the aft deck in under a minute. That’s a huge deal when you’ve got six crew members and ten guests: you’re never more than a few steps away from a good conversation, a chilled glass of rosé, or the captain’s latest tip on where the best local tavern is hidden.

The interior is exactly what you’d expect from a Sunreef: a mix of modern minimalism and warm, Mediterranean tones. The main salon is a sky‑blue oasis with a full‑length, teak‑slatted window that frames the sea like a living picture. The open‑plan layout means the kitchen, dining area, and lounge flow into each other, so the whole crew feels like one big gathering. The deck? Think sun‑bathing loungers that swivel, a glass‑front bar that turns into a nighttime lounge with soft LED lighting, and a Jacuzzi that sits just off the starboard side—perfect for watching the sunset melt into the horizon while you sip a spritz.

### The experience on board

You’ll be greeted at the dock by a crew that feels more like a family we’ve just met. Six professionals—two chefs, a captain, a deckhand, a stewardess, and a hostess who knows every local “pocket beach.” Their job isn’t just to serve; they’re the storytellers, the navigators, and the keepers of the yacht’s “personality.”

Morning starts with a light breakfast on the forward deck, a gentle breeze fluttering the sailcloth while you sip coffee. The kitchen? A chef’s playground. Fresh fish straight from the local market in Mykonos, sliced and served with a side of Greek olives. The menu is flexible, but the best meals are the ones you pick up on the go—think grilled octopus, a drizzle of olive oil, a splash of lemon, and a glass of Assyrtiko. The kitchen crew loves improvising with whatever catches the day’s catch, and they’ll bring it to you on a silver tray as you lounge in the Jacuzzi, the water warm, the sea a gentle hiss around you.

The cabins are a mix of privacy and communal vibe. Two lavish master suites: one forward with a king‑size double, the other aft with a panoramic window that frames the island you’re anchored near. Two twin cabins for kids or friends, and a flexible “guest” cabin that you can turn into a bunk or a lounge, depending on your group’s vibe. The bathrooms are spa‑like, with marble sinks and a rain‑shower that feels like a tropical downpour. 

You’ll find the 5th cabin—an “explorer’s cabin”— tucked away near the aft deck. It’s the perfect spot to stash your SUP, Seabob, or jet‑ski. Speaking of toys, Genny’s got a small but well‑curated line. There’s a **Jacuzzi** for those “let’s‐unwind‑while‑the‑sun‑sets” moments, a **jet‑ski** that cuts through the water like a knife, a **Seabob** for those seconds when you want to be a dolphin in the crystal‑clear waters of the Cyclades, and a **SUP** for those gentle mornings where you glide across a glass‑like sea, watching the sun rise over the caldera of Santorini.

### Where would you take her?

I started in **Mykonos**—the “Party Island”—but only for the first night. An early‑morning dip in the Jacuzzi as the moon fades, then a quick, thrilling jet‑ski ride to the hidden beach of Fokos. The next day we sailed east, making the **Saronic Gulf** our playground. The island of **Aegina** offered a small, quiet harbour where the crew took us to a family‑run taverna with the best fresh fish I've ever tasted."
OCEAN DREAM,18.5,2020,"€45,000 – €55,000",4,8,4,Dinghy; Snorkel gear; Fishing equipment,Croatia,Lagoon 52,Lagoon Catamarans,"**Ocean Dream – My Favorite Catamaran in the Adriatic**

If you ever ask me what the perfect sailing week looks like, I’ll probably start with the word “catamaran,” and then, without missing a beat, I’ll say “Ocean Dream.” I first stepped aboard this Lagoon 52 back in the spring of 2022, and after a handful of voyages along the Dalmatian coast, I still can’t get the feeling of her calm, spacious decks out of my mind.

**Why Ocean Dream stands out**

First off, there’s something about a Lagoon-built catamaran that feels instantly trustworthy. The 2020‑model Lagoon 52 was designed with both performance and comfort in mind, and Ocean Dream wears those qualities like a second skin. At 18.5 m (about 60 feet) she’s big enough to feel like a floating boutique hotel, but not so massive that you feel lost in a sea of steel. The hulls are sleek, the lines are clean, and the “lighthouse” (the raised cockpit) gives you a panoramic view of the sea that feels almost cinematic.

What really makes her special is the balance between space and intimacy. The layout gives you four separate cabins—two double and two twin—so you can have a “family” feel or split the group into couples, depending on your vibe. Each cabin has its own en‑suite bathroom; the master suite even has a little balcony that lets you wake up to the first light glimmering over the islands. The interior feels like a modern Mediterranean villa: light‑filled, with natural wood accents that remind you you’re on a boat, not a hotel. The open‑plan saloon is a perfect gathering spot; the large L‑shaped sofa faces the galley, and the big windows are perfect for watching a sunset while sipping a chilled Aperol spritz you’ve mixed yourself.

The crew of four—two seasoned chefs, a captain who knows every hidden cove, and a steward who anticipates your needs before you even voice them—are more like family than staff. They’re not just there to serve; they’re there to make sure you feel the rhythm of the sea and the charm of each port you touch.

**What it feels like to be on board**

The first thing you notice when you step onto the deck is the sheer stability. There’s no need to brace yourself as the boat slices through the water; you’re gliding, almost like a gentle glide over a calm pond. The motion is so smooth that you can actually read a paperback in the lounge without the pages fluttering. And that’s because the catamaran’s twin hulls cut the waves in a way that reduces the typical “tug” you feel in a monohull.

The social areas are designed for both relaxation and entertainment. We spent an afternoon on the aft deck, lounging under a pergola that offers shade without sacrificing the sea breeze. The teak deck feels warm under your feet, and the built‑in bar means you can pour a fresh cocktail without having to go down to the kitchen. There’s a huge table for eight on the main deck; I've had dinner parties where the conversation flowed as easily as the wine.

And then there are the water toys. The dinghy is a solid 3‑meter aluminum, perfect for a quick dash to a secluded beach or for a quick “I’m still in my pajamas” breakfast on the water. Snorkel gear is stocked in the wet locker—clear, well‑maintained masks, fins, and a waterproof camera that lets you capture underwater scenes without a hassle. The fishing equipment is a nice touch; if you’re a fan of fresh‑caught sea bass, you’ll love the experience of pulling a line in the calm, clear waters of the Adriatic and then having the crew cook it up right on the grill.

**The sailing itinerary you’ll love**

Based in Croatia, Ocean Dream is perfectly positioned to explore the splendors of the Dalmatian archipelago. Our week started in the historic port of Split, where the old Roman arena and the vibrant market set a lively tone. From there, we sailed to the island of Hvar—its lavender fields and night‑time vibe are a whole experience. The yacht’s shallow draft allowed us to slip into hidden coves like the Bay of St. Nicholas, a perfect spot for a snack of locally made olive tapenade while the sun painted the cliffs gold.

From Hvar we cut across to Korčula, “the little Dubrovnik,” where the medieval walls look like something out of a fairytale. The crew dropped us off at a secluded bay where we dropped anchor and spent an entire afternoon snorkeling around a coral‑like patch of sea life that looked like a living aquarium. The water was so clear I could see my own reflection, and the snorkel gear was so comfortable I hardly felt the salt on my skin.

The next day we headed to the island of Vis, where the famed “Blue Cave”"
SERENITY,15.2,2019,"€35,000 – €42,000",3,6,3,SUP boards; Kayaks; Water skis,Italy,Bali 4.6,Catana Group,"I still remember the first time I slipped aboard Serenity in the tiny marina of Portofino. The sun was already low, painting the harbor in a soft amber, and the yacht—sleek, white, and impossibly calm— seemed to float on a cushion of sea‑air. It’s one of those moments when the ocean feels like a private invitation, and you realize you’re about to spend a week with a friend who just happens to be a 15‑meter masterpiece that’s as comfortable as a boutique hotel and as adventurous as a surf‑board‑riding dolphin.

**What makes Serenity special?**  
First, the design. Catana Group’s Bali 4.6 model is a little legend in the charter world, but Serenity takes the concept a step further. She’s built on a “space‑maximising” platform—meaning the deck feels open and airy, even though she’s only 15.2 m (about 50 feet) long. The roof is flat and wide, creating a massive, continuous lounge area that feels more like a living room with a view than a typical yacht deck. You can picture family and friends sprawled across the large, teak‑toned sofas, sipping a chilled Prosecco, and still have room for a yoga mat or a board to set up a sunrise paddle.

The interior is where the “Bali” vibe really shines. The main suite is a private suite with a king‑size bed that feels like a cloud, a walk‑in wardrobe, and a private bathroom that includes a rain‑shower big enough to fit two of us and a small, but elegant, teak bathtub. The two guest cabins are each just as thoughtful: one with a double berth, the other with twin berths that can be combined, each with its own ensuite. The space is clever, not cramped. The galley? It’s a chef’s dream: a 2‑burner stove, a decent refrigerator, a wine cooler that holds a decent collection of Italian reds, and all the cookware you’d need for a full‑blown Mediterranean feast. You’ll actually want to cook on board—there’s something magical about tossing fresh basil and lemon over a pan and watching the sun dip behind the cliffs as you plate up.

**The crew,** three of them, are like the perfect host family. The captain—an ex‑cutter, fluent in Italian, French, and a bit of Greek—knows the hidden coves of the Amalfi Coast like the back of his hand. The chef, who hails from Sicily, can turn a simple catch of sea‑bass into a plate you’ll still be dreaming about weeks later. And the steward, a jovial character who knows every local gelateria, makes sure you never have to ask for anything.

**On board,** the vibe is relaxed yet luxurious. The open‑plan layout means we’re never “inside” the yacht for long; you’re out on the deck, on the water, or in one of the three airy cabins. There’s a “room to breathe” feel that’s rare in a 15‑metre vessel. The large, sliding doors go all the way down to the waterline, so you can step out onto the calm sea like you’re stepping onto a private beach. The three‑year‑old engine hums quietly— you barely notice it, but it’s powerful enough to glide through the Gulf of Poets at a comfortable 12 knots, but also gentle enough to let the sea breeze do most of the work when you’re in a gentle breeze.

**What we did** on our week with Serenity? We started in Portofino, then set a course for the lesser‑known islands of the Tuscan archipelago—Elba, Giglio, and the tiny, untouched island of Palmarola. Those secluded coves are the kind of place you usually only see in glossy travel magazines, but we landed right on a sand‑capped cove, dropped anchor, and set up the SUP boards. The water is so clear you can see the sea‑grass dancing beneath your board. We paddled out to a hidden grotto where the sunlight played through the limestone walls, creating a kaleidoscope of blues.

The next day we hit the open water to try water‑skiing for the first time. The crew rigged a tow‑line, and we took turns gliding over a glassy sea that seemed to stretch forever. The wind picked up just enough to give a good run but not enough to feel chaotic—just perfect for a beginner’s thrill. After a few runs, we swapped the skis for kayaks, paddling quietly past sea‑eagles that perched on the cliffs, and then back to the yacht for a sunset dinner of grilled branzino, roasted rosemary potatoes, and a glass of Vermentino we’d bought at a little family winery in the hills of Tuscany. That was the kind of evening you can’t put into an itinerary, but it feels like the sea is giving you a hug and a toast at the same time.

Because Serenity is"
